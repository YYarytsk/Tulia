# Group2-P3-Tulia
## Project Description

Tulia offers virtual support groups to college-aged students at university so that they can access mental health services. While many universities have bolstered their investments in student services, students are still hesitant to utilize traditional resources. By partnering with Tulia, colleges will ensure that student needs are not being ignored and enable them to spend their mental health dollars more efficiently.
